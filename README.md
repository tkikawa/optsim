#### Material Geometry

| Material Type  | Display Color |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| medium         | Red           |
| converter      | Magenta       |
| mirror         | Yellow        |
| diffuser       | Green         |
| absorber       | Cyan          |
| detector       | Blue          |
| mixed material | Brown         |

| Particle         | Display Color |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Optical photon   | Black         |
| Charged particle | Dark red      |

* Enter the number of particles and press the `generate` button to start the simulation.
* Display charged particle and photon tracks (in dark red and black, respectively).
* Save the event display by entering the file name and pressing the `save` button.
* Rotate, zoom, and unzoom using the mouse.

![Event display](figures/eventdisplay.png)

## 4. Geometry

* Import from [various 3D formats](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/blob/master/doc/Fileformats.md).
* Binary STL files are recommended.
* Can be created with most CAD software, e.g. [Autodesk Inventor](https://www.autodesk.co.jp/products/inventor/overview) or [SolidWorks](https://www.solidworks.com/) via "File - Save As..." using the STL file type.
* Set the unit to mm in CAD software; for other units (e.g., cm, m) adjust `cadunit` in `Global.hh`.
* Avoid too fine a resolution for CAD export.

### Example with SolidWorks

Several parts of a SolidWorks assembly can be exported as follows:

1. Select the part(s) to be exported and right-click.
2. Select "Invert selection" and then use "Suppress" on all other parts.
3. Now you can save that single part as STL (make sure the option "Do not translate STL output data to positive space" is checked and use the same coordinate system for every part, otherwise the different parts will not fit together).
4. You can check the positioning of the parts with, for example, [MeshLab](http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/), SolidView, Minimagics, Solidworks, etc.

## 5. Input Card File

* A text file specifying simulation parameters.
* Lines beginning with `#` are comments.
* See [input.card](https://github.com/tkikawa/optsim/blob/master/input.card) for examples.

### Material

* Material ID, CAD file name, and material type must be specified.
* Material properties need to be set for some types of materials.
* Different material IDs must be given for each material.
* When the geometries of two materials overlap, the material with the smaller ID is used in the overlapped region.

![Material of overlapped region](figures/overlap.png)

#### Material Type

| Material Type | Description                                                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| medium        | Normal medium in which the photon transmits.                                          |
| scintillator  | Like medium, but the scintillation photons can be generated in charged particle mode. |
| converter     | Like medium, but the photon are isotropically scattered when it enters the material.  |
| mirror        | When the photon reaches the surface of the material, it is specularly reflected.      |
| diffuser      | When the photon reaches the surface of the material, it is diffusely reflected.       |
| absorber      | When the photon reaches the surface of the material, it is absorbed.                  |
| detector      | Like absorber, but tagged as detected in the output.                                  |

* A mixture of existing materials can also be defined to simulate the optical photons' behavior probabilistically.
* For example, a mixture of 70% reflector and 30% absorber can be defined as follows, which causes incoming photons to be reflected with 70% probability and absorbed with 30% probability.

```txt
[Material]
1 cover.stl 0.7 reflector 0.3 absorber
```

#### Material Properties

Properties that need to be or can be set for `medium` and `converter` materials:

| Material Property         | Mandatory/Optional | Unit          | Default      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| Refractive index          | Mandatory          | dimensionless | 1            |
| Attenuation length        | Optional           | mm            | 0 (inactive) |
| Scattering length         | Optional           | mm            | 0 (inactive) |

* Add the values for the above parameters in the listed order after the Material Type.
* If any parameters are omitted, the default values shown in the table are applied.
* Scintillation probability and Cherenkov probability are valid only for charged particle mode.
* By default, Rayleigh scattering is activated by setting the scattering length to a non-zero value.
* A normal medium with refractive\_index = 1.592, attenuation\_length = 100 mm, no scattering can be defined as follows:

```txt
[Material]
1 scintillator.stl medium 1.592 100 0
```

## 8. Simulation Process

The simulation procedure differs depending on the particle mode.

### Photon Mode

When the **particle mode is set to `photon`**, the following process is applied:

1. **Initial position and direction of each optical photon** are sampled according to the `[Source]` and `[Direction]` settings in the input card file.
2. For each optical photon, the simulation proceeds as follows:

   * Track and material boundary intersections are computed.
   * At each boundary:

     * **medium**: Reflection or refraction using Fresnel equations.
     * **converter**: Reflection or refraction using Fresnel equations, but the photon are isotropically scattered when it enters the material.
     * **mirror**: Specular reflection.
     * **diffuser**: Lambertian (cosine law) reflection.
     * **absorber/detector**: Absorbed or detected.
   * Inside each material, absorption or scattering is determined by the step length and material parameters.
   * This process repeats until the photon is absorbed or exits the world.

![Behavior of optical photon in the boundary](figures/boundary.png)

### Charged Particle Mode

When the **particle mode is set to `electron`, `muon`, `pion` or `proton`**:

1. **Initial position and direction of each charged particle** are sampled according to the `[Source]` and `[Direction]` settings in the input card file.
2. The passage of each charged particle through the geometry is simulated.
3. As the charged particle traverses the medium, the production of **scintillation photons** or **Cherenkov photons** is simulated based on Bethe–Bloch equation and Frank–Tamm formula, respectively.
4. For each generated optical photon:

   * **Initial position and direction** are determined according to the physical processes (e.g., random along the charged particle's path, appropriate angular distribution).
   * Each optical photon is then tracked through the geometry following the same procedure as in photon mode (steps 2 and onward above).
